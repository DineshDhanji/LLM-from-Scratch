# LLM-from-Scratch

This repository provides a foundational implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch using PyTorch. It serves as an educational resource for understanding the inner workings of transformer-based models, including tokenization, model architecture, training, and text generation.

### üìÅ Repository Structure

- `LLM from Scratch.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that walks through the entire process of building and training the LLM.
- `model.py`: Contains the PyTorch implementation of the transformer-based model architecture.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data preprocessing, tokenization, and other helper methods.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DineshDhanji/LLM-from-Scratch.git
   cd LLM-from-Scratch
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

### üß† Project Overview

The project focuses on demystifying the components of an LLM by building one from the ground up. Key aspects include:

- Tokenization: Breaking down text into tokens suitable for model ingestion.
- Model Architecture: Implementing transformer blocks, attention mechanisms, and positional encoding.
- Training Loop: Setting up the training process with loss computation and optimization.
- Text Generation: Using the trained model to generate coherent text

### üìö Learning Objectives

By engaging with this repository, you will:

- Gain a deeper understanding of transformer-based LLMs.
- Learn how to implement key components of an LLM using PyTorch.
- Understand the data preprocessing steps necessary for training language models.
- Develop skills to train and evaluate your own LLMs.
